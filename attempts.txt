TUNGUSKA CHESS ENGINE - IMPROVEMENT ATTEMPTS LOG
================================================================================
Baseline: 673/1500 (44.9%)

ATTEMPT 1: PVS (Principal Variation Search) - ALL moves zero-window
    Change: After first legal move, all subsequent moves searched with zero-window
            [-alpha-1, -alpha], re-search with full window on fail-high.
    Result: 668/1500 (44.5%) - FAILED (-5)
    Why: PVS without a reliable PV move causes too many re-searches.
         Without a strong first move from the TT, most zero-window searches
         fail high, requiring expensive re-searches that waste time at 50ms/pos.
    Action: REVERTED

ATTEMPT 2: PVS (Principal Variation Search) - only with hash move
    Change: Same as PVS but only use zero-window when we have a hash/PV move
            (pvMove != NO_MOVE). This ensures the first move is likely best.
    Result: 677/1500 (45.1%) - SUCCESS (+4)
    Why: With a hash move from TT, the first move IS usually best, so zero-window
         searches for subsequent moves produce cutoffs efficiently.
    Action: KEPT

ATTEMPT 3: Mate Distance Pruning (MDP)
    Change: Uncommented existing MDP code that tightens alpha-beta window when
            a forced mate distance is known.
    Result: 679/1500 (45.3%) - SUCCESS (+2 additional)
    Why: Safe pruning that narrows window for mate sequences. Helps in tactical
         positions without any risk of missing better moves.
    Action: KEPT

ATTEMPT 4: Internal Iterative Reductions (IIR)
    Change: When no hash move available and depth > 3, reduce depth by 1.
    Result: 672/1500 (44.8%) - FAILED (-7 from 679)
    Why: At short time controls (50ms), IIR reduces depth too aggressively when
         no hash move exists. The engine needs those extra plies to find the
         right move. IIR is more effective at longer time controls where the
         speed/depth tradeoff is favorable.
    Action: REVERTED

ATTEMPT 5: Aggressive Null Move Pruning (R = 3 + depth/3)
    Change: Increased null move reduction from R = 2 + depth/6 to R = 3 + depth/3.
    Result: 649/1500 (43.3%) - FAILED (-30 from 679)
    Why: Way too aggressive. The high reduction means the null-move verification
         search is too shallow, causing false cutoffs in positions where the
         opponent has strong tactical threats. The original R formula is well-tuned
         for this engine's evaluation and time control.
    Action: REVERTED

ATTEMPT 6: Moderate Null Move Pruning (R = 2 + depth/4)
    Change: Slightly increased from R = 2 + depth/6 to R = 2 + depth/4.
    Result: 649/1500 (43.3%) - FAILED (-30 from 679)
    Why: Even this moderate increase is too much. The engine's evaluation is not
         accurate enough at low depths to support more aggressive null-move cuts.
         The existing R = 2 + depth/6 is well-calibrated.
    Action: REVERTED

ATTEMPT 7: LMR with logarithmic tables (R = 0.75 + ln(d)*ln(m)/2.25)
    Change: Replaced flat LMR reductions (1 or 2) with a logarithmic table.
    Result: 637/1500 (42.5%) - FAILED (-42 from 679)
    Why: The logarithmic formula reduces WAY too much for later moves. At depth 10
         with move 20, the reduction is ~4 plies, which is too aggressive. Combined
         with PVS zero-window, many important moves are searched too shallow and
         then require expensive re-searches.
    Action: REVERTED

ATTEMPT 8: LMR with conservative logarithmic (R = 0.5 + ln(d)*ln(m)/3.0)
    Change: More conservative logarithmic LMR formula.
    Result: 621/1500 (41.4%) - FAILED (-58 from 679)
    Why: Even with reduced coefficients, the logarithmic scaling still over-reduces
         at the depths this engine typically reaches (6-10). The flat reduction
         of 1-2 is actually well-suited for the engine's search characteristics.
    Action: REVERTED

Improvement over baseline: +6 points (+0.4%)
